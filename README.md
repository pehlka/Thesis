# Thesis
## CofC Thesis Project

These are the R markdown files that I am using for my thesis project.

The condensed file that contains all of the important, usable statistics is found in the **"Thesis_Stats_all"** file. The data files associated with it that you'll need are also uploaded. Some of the file names are different from the names I gave the data in R.

They are:

lab_data

McElroy_habitat_Data2

Field_Transects_Substrate_Totals

Field_Transects_Substrate_Totals_condensed

Field_Transects_Substrate_heaviness

fieldspeed_final

fieldspeed_final_reduced
