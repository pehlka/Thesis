Question 2: How does "available" habitat affect Racerunner locomotion?
 Ho: Racerunners run the same on all substrates.
 Ha: Racerunners run fastest on sand compared to debris and sand/debris.

> Data used to answer this question:
   > lab experiment data
      > velocity vs. substrate type - lme
      > acceleration vs. substrate type - lme
      > bipedalism vs. substrate type - lme
         > does bipedalism affect velocity? bipedalism vs velocity - lme
      > power vs. substrate type ? - lme
      > time vs. substrate type ? - lme
   > McElroy habitat data 
      > speed vs. ground clutter crossed -- are speeds faster when more/less ground clutter is crossed?
