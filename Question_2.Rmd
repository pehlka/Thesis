Question 2: How does "available" habitat affect Racerunner locomotion?
 Ho: Racerunners run the same on all substrates.
 Ha: Racerunners run fastest on sand compared to debris and sand/debris.

> Data used to answer this question:
    lab experiment data
      velocity vs. substrate type
      acceleration vs. substrate type
      bipedalism vs. substrate type
      power vs. substrate type ?
      time vs. substrate type ?
